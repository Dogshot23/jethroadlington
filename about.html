        <p>About Jethro Adlington.</p>
        <p>Born: Nottingham.</p>
        <p>Early life: St Annes and then moved up to a council house in Sherwood.</p>
        <p>School: High Pavement Grammar School, where I requested my educational options as biology, chemistry and art. My teacher said that art wasn’t appropriate and that I should do physics.</p>
        <p>Jobs: Dental technician, played guitar in a couple of bands, microbiologist, environmental consultant and finally as a psychotherapist.</p>

        <p>My artwork:</p>
        <p>In 2018, I went to the site of a Roman villa in Chedworth. It was quite a hill trek to get to the villa and that, combined with the walk around the site under a blaring sun, left me hot and fatigued.</p>
        <p>I sat outside to take a drink of water. When I looked down I saw, half hidden in the soil, what looked like the remains of an old mobile phone.</p>
        <p>I pulled it out of the soil; it was a smashed up iPod.</p>
        <p>I thought about how this piece of modern technology, almost lost in the grass and soil, might end up as a treasured “relic” in the years to come.</p>
        <p>This led me to the creation of my own “relic” prints, constructed in part from discarded electronic pieces: outdated mobile phones, radios, computer keyboards etc. I then added more found waste to highlight the hidden nature of the electronic items.</p>
        <p>The prints encompass the theme of waste as art, as well as highlighting the fact that so much electronic waste goes back to the ground; back to where it came. This also gave rise to my thoughts on mortality; we inevitably go back to ground and become relics.</p>
        <p>The Latin titles are a “nod” to my original visit to the Roman villa at Chedworth.</p>
        <p>Each piece is unique, with no two the prints same.They are prints, but are as original as an oil painting.</p>

                “ Look at this watch, it’s worthless, it cost about 10 dollars<br>
                from a vendor in the street. But if I take it, bury it I the sand for 1000 years, it becomes priceless.”
